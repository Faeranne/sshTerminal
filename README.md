#Building
========

Case: `make case`
Software: `make software`
Both: `make`

#SD CARD
=======

`software/build` should have a `rpi.img` file after `make software` is run.  Write the image to an sd card to use with the rest of the system.

#Hardware Setup
=======

The sshTermal uses both 2G network (via the Adafruit Fona) and WiFi (via generic wifi adapters, dedicated chip coming soon).  The basic setup requires both to be present before it will function.  Wiring diagrams will be uploaded soon.
